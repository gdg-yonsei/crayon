## How To Post

> You ONLY need to modify `/data/posts` folder on root for blog posting.

```
_about
  ㄴ /content.md

foo-post
  ㄴ /content.md
  ㄴ /apple.png
  ㄴ /banana.png
  ㄴ /...

bar-post
  ㄴ /content.md
  ㄴ /...

...
```

- Each post needs one folder with a unique id (folder name).
- Its content can be written in markdown and it should be named as `content.md`.
- Images for a post should be located in its post folder, or you can use external image links!
